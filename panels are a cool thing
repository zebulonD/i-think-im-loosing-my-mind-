#this is the main bit of code that you add to allow for a panel in forms to be replaced with another form. 
#i'm curently using this for a ui where when you click a button you switch pages. 



public void loadform(object Form)
        {
            if (this.main_panel.Controls.Count > 0)
                this.main_panel.Controls.RemoveAt(0);
            Form f = Form as Form;
            f.TopLevel = false;
            f.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
            this.main_panel.Controls.Add(f);
            this.main_panel.Tag = f;
            f.Show();
        }
